For programmers with some experience, a reference like [the Official Python docs on the csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), could help a lot, but for new programmers, I've included a fair bit of examples below. The grand goal in this Notebook is to comb a ~5,500 line spreadsheet in less than a second to count how many spam messages are contained in the file...\n",

    "So now that we can read files we can speed up a lot of work for ourselves! One important question remains: how can we access individual items in each row? Part of that is lies in the `print(', '.join(row))` statement. I don't think `join` is the most intuitive function, but it just takes a List of items and puts them together with `', '` between. Printing with commas between fields is not that important, but it is important to know that `row` in the code above is a Python List of field values. In code, the first row would be written like this: `row_1 = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]` Accessing an element in this List is as easy as `row_1[0]` is `\"a\"`, `row_1[1]` is `\"b\"`, and so on.\n",
