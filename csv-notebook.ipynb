    "Being able to use the `csv` module in Python is as simple as `import csv`, however there is a lot to how to use this code correctly. For programmers with some experience, a reference like [the Official Python docs on the csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html), could help a lot, but for new programmers, I've included a fair bit of examples below. The grand goal in this Notebook is to comb a ~5,500 line spreadsheet in less than a second to count how many spam messages are contained in the file...\n",
